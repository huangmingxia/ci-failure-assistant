[10:26:15] Starting analysis for launch 768194
[10:26:16] Environment validation: PASSED
[10:26:17] ReportPortal connection: SUCCESS
[10:26:20] Retrieved 6 failed test cases:
           - OCP-22760 (18,235 bytes)

[10:26:21] Log filtering: Not required (all logs <200 lines)
[10:26:22] Deduplication analysis: Started
[10:26:25] Deduplication results:
           - GROUP 1: Runtime panic (5 cases) - UNIQUE FAILURE 1
           - GROUP 2: AWS AssumeRole test (1 case) - UNIQUE FAILURE 2
           - Total unique failures: 2 (from 6 case IDs)
           - Deduplication efficiency: 67% reduction

[10:26:26] Parallel analysis: Launching 2 tasks
[10:26:27] Task 1: Analyzing runtime panic failure (cases 22760,23165,25310,33374,39747)
[10:26:27] Task 2: Analyzing AWS AssumeRole failure (case 40825)

[10:28:45] Task 1 completed: Runtime panic analysis
           - Root cause: Image parsing logic failure
           - Classification: E2E Bug
           - Risk level: HIGH
           - Evidence: Digest vs tag format mismatch

[10:28:47] Task 2 completed: AWS AssumeRole analysis
           - Root cause: Environment contamination
           - Classification: E2E Bug  
           - Risk level: LOW-MEDIUM
           - Evidence: Pre-existing IAM resources

[10:28:48] Analysis completion: All tasks successful
[10:28:49] Report generation: Starting single MultiEdit operation
[10:29:15] Report generation: Completed successfully
