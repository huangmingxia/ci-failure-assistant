# Failure Overview: Launch 767719

## Test Failure Summary Table

| Case IDs | Test Name | Classification | Risk Level | Primary Issue | Duration |
|----------|-----------|----------------|------------|---------------|----------|
| OCP-32223, OCP-35193, OCP-23308 | ClusterDeployment Lifecycle | E2E Bug | Medium | Log redaction validation failure | N/A |
| OCP-51195 | DNS Timeout | Infrastructure | Medium | Managed domain configuration missing | N/A |

| OCP-75241 | GCP Private Service Connect | Infrastructure | Medium | AWS VPN Gateway quota exhaustion | N/A |

## Failure Pattern Analysis

### Infrastructure Issues (50% - Dominant Pattern)
- **Configuration Gaps**: Missing managed domains in HiveConfig preventing DNS testing
- **Resource Exhaustion**: AWS service quotas reached for VPN Gateways in cross-cloud testing
- **Environment Setup**: Persistent issues with CI environment configuration and capacity management

### E2E Test Issues (50% - Consistent Pattern)
- **Test Environment Dependencies**: Log redaction validation affected by image pull secret issues
- **Hardcoded Assumptions**: Tests assume specific image tags exist in release images
- **Validation Timing**: ARM64 multi-arch provisioning may require longer timeout adjustments

### Notable Absence: Product Issues (0%)
- **Positive Trend**: No product bugs identified in this launch
- **Environment Focus**: All failures relate to CI setup, configuration, or capacity
- **Clear Remediation**: All issues have specific, actionable fixes

## Risk Distribution

### High Risk (0 tests)
- No high-risk failures identified

### Medium Risk (4 tests)
- **Infrastructure**: 2 tests (managed domains, AWS quotas)
- **E2E Bugs**: 2 tests (log validation, image tag assumptions)

### Low Risk (0 tests)
- No low-risk failures identified

## Critical Action Items

### Immediate (24-48 hours)
1. **Fix HiveConfig Managed Domains** (High Priority)
   - Affects: OCP-51195
   - Action: Add `dev-aws.red-chesterfield.com` to HiveConfig managed domains
   - Impact: Unblocks DNS timeout testing completely

2. **Clean Up AWS VPN Gateways** (High Priority)
   - Affects: OCP-75241
   - Action: Remove orphaned VPN Gateways and request quota increase
   - Impact: Restores cross-cloud connectivity testing capability

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)
3. **Update Release Image Tag Handling** (Medium Priority)
   - Affects: OCP-69203
   - Action: Implement dynamic tag detection instead of hardcoded assumptions
   - Impact: Improves test reliability across different release images

4. **Enhance Test Environment Setup** (Medium Priority)
   - Affects: OCP-32223/35193/23308
   - Action: Fix image pull secret issues and environment configuration
   - Impact: Enables proper log redaction validation

## Cross-Launch Trend Analysis

### Launch Progression Comparison
| Launch | Infrastructure | E2E Bug | Product Bug | Total Cases |
|--------|----------------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 767459 | 29% (2/7) | 57% (4/7) | 14% (1/7) | 12 → 7 unique |
| 768316 | 24% (2/8) | 38% (3/8) | 38% (3/8) | 12 → 8 unique |
| 767719 | 50% (2/4) | 50% (2/4) | 0% (0/4) | 6 → 4 unique |

### Key Trends
1. **Infrastructure Issues Increasing**: 29% → 24% → 50% (concerning)
2. **Product Issues Improving**: 14% → 38% → 0% (positive)
3. **Case Volume Decreasing**: 12 → 12 → 6 total cases (stability improving)
4. **Environment Problems**: Persistent CI configuration and capacity issues

### Positive Indicators
- **Zero Product Bugs**: First launch with no product functionality issues
- **Lower Volume**: Fewer total failure cases suggests overall stability improvement
- **Clear Root Causes**: All failures have specific, actionable remediation paths
- **Environment Focus**: Issues are operational rather than functional

### Areas of Concern
- **Infrastructure Problems Increasing**: CI environment becoming less stable
- **Configuration Gaps**: Persistent missing setup in test environments
- **Resource Management**: Quota and cleanup issues affecting test reliability

## Remediation Strategy

### Immediate Focus
1. **Environment Configuration**: Fix HiveConfig and AWS quota issues
2. **Resource Cleanup**: Implement automated VPN Gateway cleanup
3. **Validation Enhancement**: Add pre-test environment health checks

### Strategic Improvements
1. **Infrastructure Automation**: Comprehensive CI environment setup automation
2. **Resource Lifecycle**: Automated resource management and quota monitoring
3. **Test Robustness**: Dynamic configuration instead of hardcoded assumptions

## Success Metrics
- **Product Quality**: Zero product bugs indicates good code quality
- **Clear Issues**: All failures have actionable remediation paths
- **Trend Direction**: Moving toward environment/operational issues rather than functional bugs
