# Individual Analysis Report: OCP-75241

## Summary
- **Case ID**: OCP-75241 (unique failure)
- **Test Title**: Enable GCP Private Service Connect cluster
- **Failure Description**: Test failed when attempting to create AWS VPN Gateway due to service quota exhaustion
- **Timestamp**: Failed during launch 767719

## Root Cause
**Primary Issue**: AWS Service Quota Exhaustion
- AWS API error: "VpnGatewayLimitExceeded: The maximum number of virtual private gateways has been reached"
- Test creates cross-cloud VPN connectivity between GCP and AWS infrastructure
- AWS account hit maximum quota for Virtual Private Gateways (typically 5 per region)
- Previous test runs or concurrent tests likely accumulated VPN Gateways without proper cleanup

**Contributing Factors**:
- Resource cleanup issues from previous test executions
- Concurrent test execution creating multiple VPN Gateways simultaneously
- Lack of quota monitoring and management in test environment
- Insufficient test isolation between runs in same AWS account/region

## Failure Type & Risk
**Classification**: Infrastructure Issue (Resource Quota Exhaustion)
**Risk Level**: Medium
- Not a bug in test logic or product code
- Blocks testing of cross-cloud connectivity features
- Will consistently fail until quota addressed
- Affects any tests requiring AWS VPN Gateway creation

## Evidence
- AWS EC2 API error at `hive_aws.go:7233` in `CreateVpnGateway` function
- Error details: `StatusCode: 400, RequestID: 1df83495-3545-4c61-930b-4afa19cbae10`
- Specific quota error: `VpnGatewayLimitExceeded`
- Test timestamp: August 30, 2025, 02:22:35 GMT
- Test creates hybrid GCP-AWS infrastructure with VPN tunnels for connectivity

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fix
1. **Clean Up Existing VPN Gateways**:
   ```bash
   # Identify orphaned VPN Gateways
   aws ec2 describe-vpn-gateways --region us-east-1 --query 'VpnGateways[?State==`available`]'
   
   # Delete unused VPN Gateways (verify not in use)
   aws ec2 delete-vpn-gateway --vpn-gateway-id vgw-xxxxxxxxx
   ```

2. **Request Quota Increase**: Submit AWS service quota increase for VPN Gateways (5 â†’ 10-15 per region)

3. **Immediate Workaround**: Run test in different AWS region with available quota

### Long-term Prevention
1. **Automated Cleanup**: Enhanced defer functions and scheduled cleanup jobs for orphaned resources
2. **Quota Monitoring**: CloudWatch alarms and dashboards for VPN Gateway usage tracking
3. **Test Environment Improvements**: Separate AWS accounts, resource tagging, lifecycle management
4. **Framework Enhancements**: Pre-flight quota checks and resource pool management
5. **Code Improvements**: Add quota validation before resource creation with appropriate buffers

This is clear infrastructure capacity issue requiring immediate resource cleanup and quota management improvements for stable test execution.
