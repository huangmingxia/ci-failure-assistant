Step 2.5 - Deduplication Analysis
----------------------------------
✓ Analyzed filtered logs for duplicate test cases
✓ Identified test case groupings by failure patterns
✓ Deduplication results: 12 Case IDs → 8 unique failures (33% reduction)

Unique Test Groups Identified:
1. Global Pull Secret: OCP-25145 (unique)
2. Deprovision Controller: OCP-28631 (unique)
3. Machinepool Autoscale: OCP-28867, OCP-41776
4. ClusterPool Support: OCP-33832, OCP-42251, OCP-43033
5. Spot Instances: OCP-34148 (unique)
6. Claim Lifetime: OCP-35209 (unique)
7. Failed Provision Config: OCP-46016 (unique)
8. OVN IPv4 Subnet: OCP-78024, OCP-81347

Step 3-7 - Parallel Analysis
----------------------------
✓ Launched 8 parallel analysis tasks for unique failures
✓ Each task analyzed: test intent, failure point, root cause, classification, risk, recommendations
✓ All analyses completed successfully
✓ Processing time: ~5 minutes per unique case (parallel execution)

Analysis Results Summary:
- Product Bugs: 3 cases (38%)
- E2E Bugs: 3 cases (38%)
- Infrastructure Issues: 2 cases (24%)

Step 8 - Report Generation
-------------------------
✓ Created individual analysis reports for all 8 unique failures
✓ Generated comprehensive summary report
✓ Created failure overview table with risk assessment
✓ Generated debug commands script with product-specific investigations
✓ Used single MultiEdit operation for maximum performance
✓ All reports created simultaneously for optimal efficiency
